# Options to control genome coverage calculations
coverage:
    # what resolution in bp do you want the coverage to be calculated?
    resolution: 5

# Options to control normalization of coverage signals
normalization:
    # how to normalize within a sample. Options include:
    # RPKM, CPM, BPM, RPGC, median, and SES. See deeptools manual for
    # details on these normalization methods.
    within: median
    # add a pseudocount to numerator and denominator in log2ratio
